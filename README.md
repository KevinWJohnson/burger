* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the burger choices     section of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the burger area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger    will move to the eaten area of the page.

* The app will stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
